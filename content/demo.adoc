## ADOC for the demo

This file was created by the best team ever. 

This chapter deals with many of the issues relating to the fundamental syntax of the Python language.

Python is case sensitive. Therefore, the following two variables are different.

[source, python]
----
 the_Person = "Him"
 the_person = "Her"
----

Python statements do not end with a semicolon, but you can use one to separate two statements on the same line.

[source, python]
----
length = 10; width = 5
area = length * width
print(area)
----

Operations done manually using `ceph-volume` might not be visible by the `cephadm` tool.

It is possible that the scheduled snapshot takes some time to be created.
